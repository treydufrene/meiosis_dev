The integration of the electrical, mechanical, and software subsystems together worked well as each subsystem was not overtly complicated. With the mechanical system assembled, cutouts along the links allowed the power and data cables to pass through the links to the servos. Because the servos were able to be daisy chained, only three wires were needed to connect the servos to each other, one for power, ground, and data. Powering and sending data to the servos is also relatively straightforward, as the MX/RX power hub receives both power from the 12V power supply in the base as well as data from the Raspberry Pi via the U2D2, allowing the MX/RX power hub to both power and transfer data to the daisy chained servos. In general, because of the use of the smart servos the integration of the three subsystems was easily accomplished.
